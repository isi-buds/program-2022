You are given a data frame called `registrar`. There are two variables you are interested in `class_year` which represents whether someone is a first year, sophomore, junior, or senior and `gpa` which represents GPA. 

How would you find the average GPA for each class rank?

`clean_names()` makes variable names in tidy style.

```{r}

arthritis <- clean_names(arthritis)
glimpse(arthritis)
```

**Goal**: 

Create a new variable called `age_months` that represents `age` in months.

---

class: middle

```{r}
arthritis %>% 
  mutate(age_months = age*12)
```

---

class: middle

```{r}
glimpse(arthritis)
```

**Goal**: 

Create a new variable called `das_level` which has the following categories based on `das_28` scores. 

remission < 2.6  
2.6 $\leq$ low disease activity $\leq$ 3.2  
3.2 < moderate disease activity $leq$ 5.1

high disease activity > 5.1


---


```{r}
arthritis %>% 
  mutate(das_level = case_when(
    das_28 < 2.6 ~ "remission", 
    das_28 >= 2.6 & das_28 <= 3.2 ~ "low disease activity",
    das_28 > 3.2 & das_28 <= 5.1 ~ "moderate disease activity",
    das_28 > 5.1 ~ "high disease activity")) 
```

## (Some) Variable Types in R

`character`: takes string values (e.g. a person's name, address)  
`integer`: integer (single precision)  
`double`: floating decimal (double precision)  
`numeric`: integer or double  
`factor`: categorical variables with different levels  
`logical`: TRUE (1), FALSE (0)  

---

class: middle

```{r}
glimpse(arthritis)
```

**Goal**: 

Change `das_28_yn` and `age_gp` to appropriate variable types. 


---

class: middle

```{r}
arthritis %>% 
  mutate(das28_yn = as.logical(das28_yn),
         age_gp = as.factor(age_gp)) 
```

---

class: middle

`as.factor()` - makes a vector factor  
`as.numeric()` - makes a vector numeric  
`as.integer()` - makes a vector integer  
`as.double()` - makes a vector double  
`as.character()` - makes a vector character

In your lecture notes, you can do all the changes in this lecture in one long set of piped code. That's the beauty of piping!

```{r eval = FALSE}
arthritis <- 
  arthritis %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
    mutate(das_level = case_when(
    das_28 < 2.6 ~ "remission", 
    das_28 >= 2.6 & das_28 <= 3.2 ~ "low disease activity",
    das_28 > 3.2 & das_28 <= 5.1 ~ "moderate disease activity",
    das_28 > 5.1 ~ "high disease activity")) %>% 
  mutate(das28_yn = as.logical(das28_yn),
         age_gp = as.factor(age_gp)) 
```

## Word of caution

The functions `clean_names()`, and `mutate()` all take a data frame as the first argument. Even though we do not see it, the data frame is piped through from the previous step of code at each step. 
When we use these functions without the `%>%` we have to include the data frame explicitly.


.pull-left[
Data frame is used as the first argument
```{r}
clean_names(arthritis)
```
]

.pull-right[
Data frame is piped

```{r}
arthritis %>% 
  clean_names()
```
]
